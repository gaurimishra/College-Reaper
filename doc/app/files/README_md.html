<h1 id="label-College-Reaper">College-Reaper</h1>

<p>The SYN/ACK group&#39;s CSE 3901 final project at OSU, hopefully with
future deployment into the wild. This is a Rails 4 application which uses
PostgreSQL for the RDBMS. Other details can be gleaned from the information
below and the <code>Gemfile</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Environment">Environment</h2>

<p>The application is set up to use RVM and Bundler to standardize the
environment. The current environment is, in RVM shorthand,
<code>ruby-2.1.2@cse3901</code>, which is MRI ruby, version 2.1.2 with no
patches, and a gemset named <code>cse3901</code> for nice isolation and
organization. These are forced, assuming RVM is present, by the
<code>.ruby-version</code> and <code>.ruby-gemset</code> files in the
project root. Running the <code>bundle install</code> command will install
the gems for the application into the appropriate gemset as well, under the
same assumption.</p>

<h2 id="label-Organization">Organization</h2>

<p>Code was organized using Rail&#39;s MVC concept. Public controller allowed
for any user, logged in or not, to access metadata including Terms of Use,
About, Contact information. The CompletionController provides the user the
ability to interact with the website to add their past completed courses,
and also to edit or remove them.</p>

<h2 id="label-How+to+Execute+College-Reaper">How to Execute College-Reaper</h2>

<p>From a terminal in your Rails development environment, type command: <code>
RAILS_ENV = development bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:migrate
db:seed  rails server </code> The web page should automatically pop up in
your web browser, where you will see local host connected with the
application. From the home page you are required to create a new account.
Once logged in, click “Create Schedule” and enter any specific preferences
on the next page. The “Next” button from the “Walking Distance” page will
compute and load your schedule.</p>

<p>Please allow some time for schedule to generate, as schedule-generator is
computationally expensive.</p>

<h2 id="label-Documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>To generate the documentation for the application, use the <code>bundle
exec rake doc:app_reaper</code> command. The <code>doc:app_reaper</code>
task uses the <code>sdoc</code> gem and will place it&#39;s output in
<code>doc/app</code>, replacing the contents of the entire directory,
should any exist when the task runs.</p>

<h2 id="label-Test+Suite">Test Suite</h2>

<p>The test suite is written using the RSpec framework, and can be run with
the <code>bundle exec rspec</code> command. Reports on the effectiveness of
test suite can be found under <code>/coverage/index.html</code> To test the
database models and migrations, FactoryGirl was used to produce test data.
After code completion, many different possible user scenarios were tested
against the system.</p>

<h2 id="label-Contributions">Contributions</h2>

<p>All team members participated in the brainstorming and planning that went
into designing College-Reaper. Once a clearly defined plan was formed,
code-writing was broken down in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Jim Cavoli- Generated skeleton, implemented schedules_controller and
associated views. Overall project manager who fairly delegated tasks and
helped when needed. Also created <a href="../classes/User.html">User</a>,
<a href="../classes/Person.html">Person</a></p>
</li><li>
<p>Ethan Hill- Implemented all methods in gen_schedule_helper module,
following a complex scoring and sorting algorithm. Worked on
schedules_controller.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Gauri Mishra- Autocomplete widget, section/term/college models, specs and
migrations. Implemented completion_controller and was testing manager.
Created db info in seeds.rb.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Elisabeth Holtman- <a href="../classes/Course.html">Course</a>, <a
href="../classes/Location.html">Location</a>, Requirement_Group and <a
href="../classes/Preference.html">Preference</a> models, specs and
migrations. Populated database with seeds.rb file with Gauri, created
bias_slider method, helped implement application_controller.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dan Carlozzi- Used Foundation framework to create the look and feel of the
application using customized stylesheets and layout for the schedule.
Incorporated Map API and contributed to public_controller.</p>
</li></ul>
